      <summary>Why "Jorengarenar"?</summary>
      <div>
        I was just scribing on a piece of paper trying to come up with cool
        nickname (starting from "Armageddon"), but it turned out to be one big
        festival of coincidences:
        <ul>
          <li>Joren means "farmer" - part of my surname has closely related meaning </li>
          <li>Joren is also a variant of name George - my 3rd name!</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The legend of <i>Saint George and the Dragon</i></li>
            <ul>
              <li>I used to be <span title="Enough to consider going into genetics to create GMO dragons!">obsessed</span> with dragons!</li>
              <li>LoL champion, <a href="https://leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/garen/">Garen</a>, also is a warrior</li>
              <ul>
                <li>I played LoL once, on friend account - guess which champion</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        And the best of all: I didn't even knew about all of this until told by
        somebody else!
