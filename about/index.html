      <p>So you have decided to learn more about me? Very well!</p>

      <p>
      The very first time the spark of programming passion had sprouted in my
      mind was after reading <i title="pl. C++ od podstaw">C++ from Scratch</i>
      by Jesse Liberty. A textbook teaching language by creating a simple game.
      Would I recommend this book for anyone nowadays? By any means <b>no</b>.
      It was published in 1999, when the first standard of C++ was just released
      in 1998, so the book doesn't even use it yet. But me? I was hooked, I've
      read it like the best novel.
      </p>

      <p>
      And so my journey with programming become with C++. Thus to every newbie
      asking what language to start with, I say...
      <a href="https://joren.ga/blog/programming/best-of-c">start with C</a>.
      </p>
